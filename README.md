adapted for EAGLE 9.2.2

If you want to use only part of it you should look at 'by type' folder. Name of file describes the editor which uses it.

`eaglerc.default` is a backup of a standard `eaglerc`.

## Installation

### Windows 
Download file `eaglerc` and copy it into `c:\users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Eagle\settings\9.2.2\`.

If you want to use only part of these, just copy lines that you need into your `eaglerc` file.
